# Data-Analysis-Using-PowerBIData-Analysis-Using-PowerBI
This project analyzes global sales data using Power BI, offering interactive dashboards to visualize sales trends, regional performance, and product insights. The dashboards provide an intuitive way to explore data, enabling better decision-making and strategic planning based on real-time insights.
## Project Objectives

- **Exploring Sales Data**: Understand the structure and content of the sales dataset.
- **Create Visualizations**: Build charts and graphs to visualize sales trends.
- **Analyze Sales**: Identify key patterns and trends in the sales data.
- **Present Insights**: Share the findings through a Power BI dashboard.

## Dataset

The analysis is based on a dataset that includes:

- **Sales Data**: Information about sales transactions, including countries, products, profit, gross sales and sales amounts.

## Power BI Dashboard

I created a Power BI dashboard that includes:

- **Sales Summary**: Overview of total sales by region, Segment and product category.
- **Monthly Sales** Overview: A clustered bar chart displaying sales trends over time, highlighting the changes in sales for each month.
- **Top Products**: Bar chart highlighting the best-selling products.
- **Country-wise Profit Analysis:** A decomposition tree that breaks down profit by country, allowing for detailed insights into how each region contributes to overall profitability. Users can explore subcategories for deeper analysis.
- **Quarterly and Product-wise Profit Distribution:** A visual representation showing profit distribution across different quarters and products, helping to identify top-performing products and seasonal trends in profitability.
- **Slicers and Bookmarks:** Created slicers for year-wise reports and created bookmarks for easy access to filtered data.
- **Navigation Buttons:** Created buttons for navigating through pages.
